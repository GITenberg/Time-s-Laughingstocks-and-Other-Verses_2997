v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> collecting the following poems I
have to thank the editors and proprietors of the periodicals in
which certain of them have appeared for permission to reclaim
them.</p>
<p>Now that the miscellany is brought together, some lack of
concord in pieces written at widely severed dates, and in
contrasting moods and circumstances, will be obvious
enough.&nbsp; This I cannot help, but the sense of disconnection,
particularly in respect of those lyrics penned in the first
person, will be immaterial when it is borne in mind that they are
to be regarded, in the main, as dramatic monologues by different
characters.</p>
<p>As a whole they will, I hope, take the reader forward, even if
not far, rather than backward.&nbsp; I should add that some lines
in the early-dated poems have been rewritten, though they have
been left substantially unchanged.</p>

1</span>TIME&rsquo;S LAUGHINGSTOCKS</h2>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
REVISITATION</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">As</span>
I lay awake at night-time<br />
In an ancient country barrack known to ancient cannoneers,<br />
And recalled the hopes that heralded each seeming brave and
bright time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of my primal purple years,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much it haunted me that, nigh
there,<br />
I had borne my bitterest loss&mdash;when One who went, came not
again;<br />
In a joyless hour of discord, in a joyless-hued July
there&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A July just such as then.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as thus I brooded
longer,<br />
With my faint eyes on the feeble square of wan-lit window
frame,<br />
A quick conviction sprung within me, grew, and grew yet
stronger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the month-night was the same,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too, as that which saw her
leave me<br />
On the rugged ridge of Waterstone, the peewits plaining round;<br
/>
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>And a
lapsing twenty years had ruled that&mdash;as it were to grieve
me&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I should near the once-loved ground.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though but now a war-worn
stranger<br />
Chance had quartered here, I rose up and descended to the
yard.<br />
All was soundless, save the troopers&rsquo; horses tossing at the
manger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sentry keeping guard.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the gateway I betook
me<br />
Down the High Street and beyond the lamps, across the battered
bridge,<br />
Till the country darkness clasped me and the friendly shine
forsook me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I bore towards the Ridge,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a dim unowned emotion<br
/>
Saying softly: &ldquo;Small my reason, now at midnight, to be
here . . .<br />
Yet a sleepless swain of fifty with a brief romantic notion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May retrace a track so dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I walked with thoughts
half-uttered<br />
Up the lane I knew so well, the grey, gaunt, lonely Lane of
Slyre;<br />
And at whiles behind me, far at sea, a sullen thunder muttered<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mounted high and higher.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Till, the upper roadway quitting,<br
/>
I adventured on the open drouthy downland thinly grassed,<br />
While the spry white scuts of conies flashed before me, earthward
flitting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And an arid wind went past.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about me bulged the
barrows<br />
As before, in antique silence&mdash;immemorial funeral
piles&mdash;<br />
Where the sleek herds trampled daily the remains of flint-tipt
arrows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mid the thyme and chamomiles;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Sarsen stone there,
dateless,<br />
On whose breast we had sat and told the zephyrs many a tender
vow,<br />
Held the heat of yester sun, as sank thereon one fated
mateless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From those far fond hours till now.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe flustered by my
presence<br />
Rose the peewits, just as all those years back, wailing soft and
loud,<br />
And revealing their pale pinions like a fitful phosphorescence<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up against the cope of cloud,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where their dolesome
exclamations<br />
Seemed the voicings of the self-same throats I had heard when
life was green,<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Though since
that day uncounted frail forgotten generations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their kind had flecked the scene.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, living long and
longer<br />
In a past that lived no more, my eyes discerned there,
suddenly,<br />
That a figure broke the skyline&mdash;first in vague contour,
then stronger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And was crossing near to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some long-missed familiar
gesture,<br />
Something wonted, struck me in the figure&rsquo;s pause to list
and heed,<br />
Till I fancied from its handling of its loosely wrapping
vesture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That it might be She indeed.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas not reasonless:
below there<br />
In the vale, had been her home; the nook might hold her even
yet,<br />
And the downlands were her father&rsquo;s fief; she still might
come and go there;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So I rose, and said, &ldquo;Agnette!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little leap,
half-frightened,<br />
She withdrew some steps; then letting intuition smother fear<br
/>
In a place so long-accustomed, and as one whom thought
enlightened,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She replied: &ldquo;What&mdash;<i>that</i>
voice?&mdash;here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>&ldquo;Yes, Agnette!&mdash;And did the
occasion<br />
Of our marching hither make you think I <i>might</i> walk where
we two&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O, I often come,&rdquo; she murmured with a moment&rsquo;s
coy evasion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;(&rsquo;Tis not far),&mdash;and&mdash;think
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I took her hand, and led
her<br />
To the ancient people&rsquo;s stone whereon I had sat.&nbsp;
There now sat we;<br />
And together talked, until the first reluctant shyness fled
her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she spoke confidingly.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It is <i>just</i> as
ere we parted!&rdquo;<br />
Said she, brimming high with joy.&mdash;&ldquo;And when, then,
came you here, and why?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;&mdash;Dear, I could not sleep for thinking of our
trystings when twin-hearted.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She responded, &ldquo;Nor could I.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are few things I
would rather<br />
Than be wandering at this spirit-hour&mdash;lone-lived, my
kindred dead&mdash;<br />
On this wold of well-known feature I inherit from my father:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Night or day, I have no dread . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O I wonder, wonder
whether<br />
Any heartstring bore a signal-thrill between us twain or
no?&mdash;<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Some such
influence can, at times, they say, draw severed souls
together.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Dear, we&rsquo;ll dream it
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one&rsquo;s hand the
other&rsquo;s grasping,<br />
And a mutual forgiveness won, we sank to silent thought,<br />
A large content in us that seemed our rended lives reclasping,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And contracting years to nought.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I, maybe overweary<br />
From the lateness, and a wayfaring so full of strain and
stress<br />
For one no longer buoyant, to a peak so steep and eery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sank to slow unconsciousness . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long I slept I knew
not,<br />
But the brief warm summer night had slid when, to my swift
surprise,<br />
A red upedging sun, of glory chambered mortals view not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was blazing on my eyes,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Milton Woods to
Dole-Hill<br />
All the spacious landscape lighting, and around about my feet<br
/>
Flinging tall thin tapering shadows from the meanest mound and
mole-hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on trails the ewes had beat.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>She was sitting still beside me,<br />
Dozing likewise; and I turned to her, to take her hanging
hand;<br />
When, the more regarding, that which like a spectre shook and
tried me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In her image then I scanned;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which Time&rsquo;s
transforming chisel<br />
Had been tooling night and day for twenty years, and tooled too
well,<br />
In its rendering of crease where curve was, where was raven,
grizzle&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pits, where peonies once did dwell.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had wakened, and
perceiving<br />
(I surmise) my sigh and shock, my quite involuntary dismay,<br />
Up she started, and&mdash;her wasted figure all throughout it
heaving&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, &ldquo;Ah, yes: I am <i>thus</i> by day!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you really wince
and wonder<br />
That the sunlight should reveal you such a thing of skin and
bone,<br />
As if unaware a Death&rsquo;s-head must of need lie not far
under<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flesh whose years out-count your own?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes: that movement was
a warning<br />
Of the worth of man&rsquo;s devotion!&mdash;Yes, Sir, I am
<i>old</i>,&rdquo; said she,<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>&ldquo;And
the thing which should increase love turns it quickly into
scorning&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And your new-won heart from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she went, ere I could
call her,<br />
With the too proud temper ruling that had parted us before,<br />
And I saw her form descend the slopes, and smaller grow and
smaller,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I caught its course no more . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True; I might have dogged her
downward;<br />
&mdash;But it <i>may</i> be (though I know not) that this trick
on us of Time<br />
Disconcerted and confused me.&mdash;Soon I bent my footsteps
townward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like to one who had watched a crime.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I knew my native
weakness,<br />
Well I know it still.&nbsp; I cherished her reproach like
physic-wine,<br />
For I saw in that emaciate shape of bitterness and bleakness<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A nobler soul than mine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I not return, then,
ever?&mdash;<br />
Did we meet again?&mdash;mend all?&mdash;Alas, what greyhead
perseveres!&mdash;<br />
Soon I got the Route elsewhither.&mdash;Since that hour I have
seen her never:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is lame at fifty years.</p>

The sun-blaze burning on our backs,<br />

<p><span
class="smcap">Notes</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Windwhistle&rdquo;
(Stanza iv.).&nbsp; The highness and dryness of Windwhistle Inn
was impressed upon the writer two or three years ago, when, after
climbing on a hot afternoon to the beautiful spot near which it
stands and entering the inn for tea, he was informed by the
landlady that none could be had, unless he would fetch water from
a valley half a mile off, the house containing not a drop, owing
to its situation.&nbsp; However, a tantalizing row of full
barrels behind her back testified to a wetness of a certain sort,
which was not at that time desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marshal&rsquo;s Elm&rdquo; (Stanza vi.) so
picturesquely <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>situated, is no longer an inn, though the house, or part
of it, still remains.&nbsp; It used to exhibit a fine old
swinging sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue Jimmy&rdquo; (Stanza x.) was a notorious
horse-stealer of Wessex in those days, who appropriated more than
a hundred horses before he was caught, among others one belonging
to a neighbour of the writer&rsquo;s grandfather.&nbsp; He was
hanged at the now demolished Ivel-chester or Ilchester jail above
mentioned&mdash;that building formerly of so many sinister
associations in the minds of the local peasantry, and the
continual haunt of fever, which at last led to its
condemnation.&nbsp; Its site is now an innocent-looking green

Passed each other without heeding, in their travail, teen, or

Some in void unvisioned listlessness inwrought with pallid

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of keen penury&rsquo;s annoy.</p>

On a red and white emblazonment of players and parts, I

(<i>circa</i> 186&ndash;)</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">bore</span> a daughter
flower-fair,<br />
In Pydel Vale, alas for me;<br />
I joyed to mother one so rare,<br />
But dead and gone I now would be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Men looked and loved her as she grew,<br />
And she was won, alas for me;<br />
She told me nothing, but I knew,<br />
And saw that sorrow was to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">I knew that one had made her thrall,<br />
A thrall to him, alas for me;<br />
And then, at last, she told me all,<br />
And wondered what her end would be.</p>
<p class="poetry">She owned that she had loved too well,<br />
Had loved too well, unhappy she,<br />
And bore a secret time would tell,<br />
Though in her shroud she&rsquo;d sooner be.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>I plodded to her sweetheart&rsquo;s door<br />
In Pydel Vale, alas for me:<br />
I pleaded with him, pleaded sore,<br />
To save her from her misery.</p>
<p class="poetry">He frowned, and swore he could not wed,<br />
Seven times he swore it could not be;<br />
&ldquo;Poverty&rsquo;s worse than shame,&rdquo; he said,<br />
Till all my hope went out of me.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve packed my traps to sail the
main&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
Roughly he spake, alas did he&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Wessex beholds me not again,<br />
&rsquo;Tis worse than any jail would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;There was a shepherd whom I knew,<br />
A subtle man, alas for me:<br />
I sought him all the pastures through,<br />
Though better I had ceased to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">I traced him by his lantern light,<br />
And gave him hint, alas for me,<br />
Of how she found her in the plight<br />
That is so scorned in Christendie.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Is there an herb . . . ?&rdquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or none?&rdquo;<br />
Yes, thus I asked him desperately.<br />
&ldquo;&mdash;There is,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a certain one . .
. &rdquo;<br />
Would he had sworn that none knew he!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;To-morrow I will walk your way,&rdquo;<br />
He hinted low, alas for me.&mdash;<br />
Fieldwards I gazed throughout next day;<br />
Now fields I never more would see!</p>
<p class="poetry">The sunset-shine, as curfew strook,<br />
As curfew strook beyond the lea,<br />
Lit his white smock and gleaming crook,<br />
While slowly he drew near to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">He pulled from underneath his smock<br />
The herb I sought, my curse to be&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;At times I use it in my flock,&rdquo;<br />
He said, and hope waxed strong in me.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis meant to balk
ill-motherings&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
(Ill-motherings!&nbsp; Why should they be?)&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;If not, would God have sent such things?&rdquo;<br />
So spoke the shepherd unto me.</p>
<p class="poetry">That night I watched the poppling brew,<br />
With bended back and hand on knee:<br />
I stirred it till the dawnlight grew,<br />
And the wind whiffled wailfully.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;This scandal shall be slain,&rdquo; said
I,<br />
&ldquo;That lours upon her innocency:<br />
I&rsquo;ll give all whispering tongues the lie;&rdquo;&mdash;<br

But worse than whispers was to be.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s physic for untimely fruit,&rdquo;<br

I said to her, alas for me,<br />
Early that morn in fond salute;<br />
And in my grave I now would be.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Next Sunday came, with sweet church
chimes<br />
In Pydel Vale, alas for me:<br />
I went into her room betimes;<br />
No more may such a Sunday be!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Mother, instead of rescue
nigh,&rdquo;<br />
She faintly breathed, alas for me,<br />
&ldquo;I feel as I were like to die,<br />
And underground soon, soon should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">From church that noon the people walked<br />
In twos and threes, alas for me,<br />
Showed their new raiment&mdash;smiled and talked,<br />
Though sackcloth-clad I longed to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Came to my door her lover&rsquo;s friends,<br
/>
And cheerly cried, alas for me,<br />
&ldquo;Right glad are we he makes amends,<br />
For never a sweeter bride can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">My mouth dried, as &rsquo;twere scorched
within,<br />
Dried at their words, alas for me:<br />
More and more neighbours crowded in,<br />
(O why should mothers ever be!)</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Ha-ha!&nbsp; Such well-kept news!&rdquo; laughed
they,<br />
Yes&mdash;so they laughed, alas for me.<br />
&ldquo;Whose banns were called in church to-day?&rdquo;&mdash;<br
/>
Christ, how I wished my soul could flee!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Where is she?&nbsp; O the stealthy
miss,&rdquo;<br />
Still bantered they, alas for me,<br />
&ldquo;To keep a wedding close as this . . .&rdquo;<br />
Ay, Fortune worked thus wantonly!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But you are pale&mdash;you did not
know?&rdquo;<br />
They archly asked, alas for me,<br />
I stammered, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;some days-ago,&rdquo;<br />
While coffined clay I wished to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas done to please her, we
surmise?&rdquo;<br />
(They spoke quite lightly in their glee)<br />
&ldquo;Done by him as a fond surprise?&rdquo;<br />
I thought their words would madden me.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her lover entered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
my bird?&mdash;<br />
My bird&mdash;my flower&mdash;my picotee?<br />
First time of asking, soon the third!&rdquo;<br />
Ah, in my grave I well may be.</p>
<p class="poetry">To me he whispered: &ldquo;Since your
call&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
So spoke he then, alas for me&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt for her, and righted all.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;I think of it to agony.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s faint
to-day&mdash;tired&mdash;nothing more&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
Thus did I lie, alas for me . . .<br />
I called her at her chamber door<br />
As one who scarce had strength to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">No voice replied.&nbsp; I went within&mdash;<br
/>
O women! scourged the worst are we . . .<br />
I shrieked.&nbsp; The others hastened in<br />
And saw the stroke there dealt on me.</p>
<p class="poetry">There she lay&mdash;silent, breathless,
dead,<br />
Stone dead she lay&mdash;wronged, sinless she!&mdash;<br />
Ghost-white the cheeks once rosy-red:<br />
Death had took her.&nbsp; Death took not me.</p>
<p class="poetry">I kissed her colding face and hair,<br />
I kissed her corpse&mdash;the bride to be!&mdash;<br />
My punishment I cannot bear,<br />
But pray God <i>not</i> to pity me.</p>

avow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Through serene and surly weather we have walked

And this long night&rsquo;s dance this year&rsquo;s end eve now
finishes the spell;<br />

did that year ago, Dear,<br />
When a new strange bond between our days was formed, and felt,

first thing<br />
That the faded year can charge us with; but what avails a
word!</p>
<p class="poetry">That which makes man&rsquo;s love the lighter
and the woman&rsquo;s burn no brighter<br />
Came to pass with us inevitably while slipped the shortening year

bleak windows telling<br />
That the vows of man and maid are frail as filmy gossamere.</p>

As came from her at this from him: heart-broken quite seemed

In linhay, loft, and dairy; but we found her not at all.</p>

152</span>NIGHT IN THE OLD HOME</h3>
<p class="poetry">When the wasting embers redden the
chimney-breast,<br />
And Life&rsquo;s bare pathway looms like a desert track to me,<br

And from hall and parlour the living have gone to their rest,<br

My perished people who housed them here come back to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">They come and seat them around in their mouldy
places,<br />
Now and then bending towards me a glance of wistfulness,<br />
A strange upbraiding smile upon all their faces,<br />
And in the bearing of each a passive tristfulness.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Do you uphold me, lingering and
languishing here,<br />
A pale late plant of your once strong stock?&rdquo; I say to

Take of Life what it grants, without question!&rdquo; they answer

And, satisfied, placid, unfretting, watch Time away

crutched, and cricked, and bent,<br />
I think of Panthera, who underwent<br />
Much from insidious aches in his decline;<br />
But his aches were not radical like mine;<br />
They were the twinges of old wounds&mdash;the feel<br />
Of the hand he had lost, shorn by barbarian steel,<br />
Which came back, so he said, at a change in the air,<br />
Fingers and all, as if it still were there.<br />
My pains are otherwise: upclosing cramps<br />
And stiffened tendons from this country&rsquo;s damps,<br />
Where Panthera was never commandant.&mdash;<br />

time,<br />
And as centurion carried well his prime.<br />
In Ethiop, Araby, climes fair and fell,<br />

Nought shook him then: he was serene as brave;<br />
Yet later knew some shocks, and would grow grave<br />
When pondering them; shocks less of corporal kind<br />
Than phantom-like, that disarranged his mind;<br />
And it was in the way of warning me<br />
(By much his junior) against levity<br />
That he recounted them; and one in chief<br />
Panthera loved to set in bold relief.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a tragedy of his
Eastern days,<br />
Personal in touch&mdash;though I have sometimes thought<br />
That touch a possible delusion&mdash;wrought<br />
Of half-conviction carried to a craze&mdash;<br />
His mind at last being stressed by ails and age:&mdash;<br />
Yet his good faith thereon I well could wage.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had said it long had been a

All unbelieving.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend, you do not know,&rdquo;<br

Palestine was annexed&mdash;though sullen yet,&mdash;<br />
I, being in age some two-score years and ten<br />
And having the garrison in Jerusalem<br />
Part in my hands as acting officer<br />
Under the Governor.&nbsp; A tedious time<br />
I found it, of routine, amid a folk<br />
Restless, contentless, and irascible.&mdash;<br />
Quelling some riot, sentrying court and hall,<br />

Were put in force, and here and there were set<br />

By my ranged men for pressing forward so.<br />

Which lapped a village on its furthest slopes<br />
Called Nazareth, brimmed round by uplands nigh.<br />
In the midst thereof a fountain bubbled, where,<br />
Lime-dry from marching, our glad halt we made<br />
To rest our sick ones, and refresh us all.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here a day onward,
towards the eventide,<br />
Our men were piping to a Pyrrhic dance<br />
Trod by their comrades, when the young women came<br />
<a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>To fill
their pitchers, as their custom was.<br />
I proffered help to one&mdash;a slim girl, coy<br />
Even as a fawn, meek, and as innocent.<br />
Her long blue gown, the string of silver coins<br />
That hung down by her banded beautiful hair,<br />
Symboled in full immaculate modesty.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I was young, and
hot, and readily stirred<br />
To quick desire.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas tedious timing out<br />
The convalescence of the soldiery;<br />
And I beguiled the long and empty days<br />
By blissful yieldance to her sweet allure,<br />
Who had no arts, but what out-arted all,<br />
The tremulous tender charm of trustfulness.<br />
We met, and met, and under the winking stars<br />
That passed which peoples earth&mdash;true union, yea,<br />
To the pure eye of her simplicity.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Meanwhile the sick
found health; and we pricked on.<br />
I made her no rash promise of return,<br />
As some do use; I was sincere in that;<br />
I said we sundered never to meet again&mdash;<br />
And yet I spoke untruth unknowingly!&mdash;<br />
For meet again we did.&nbsp; Now, guess you aught?<br />
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>The
weeping mother on Calvaria<br />
Was she I had known&mdash;albeit that time and tears<br />
Had wasted rudely her once flowerlike form,<br />
And her soft eyes, now swollen with sorrowing.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Though I betrayed some
qualms, she marked me not;<br />
And I was scarce of mood to comrade her<br />
And close the silence of so wide a time<br />
To claim a malefactor as my son&mdash;<br />
(For so I guessed him).&nbsp; And inquiry made<br />
Brought rumour how at Nazareth long before<br />
An old man wedded her for pity&rsquo;s sake<br />
On finding she had grown pregnant, none knew how,<br />
Cared for her child, and loved her till he died.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well; there it ended;
save that then I learnt<br />
That he&mdash;the man whose ardent blood was mine&mdash;<br />
Had waked sedition long among the Jews,<br />
And hurled insulting parlance at their god,<br />
Whose temple bulked upon the adjoining hill,<br />
Vowing that he would raze it, that himself<br />
<a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Was god
as great as he whom they adored,<br />
And by descent, moreover, was their king;<br />
With sundry other incitements to misrule.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The impalements done,
and done the soldiers&rsquo; game<br />
Of raffling for the clothes, a legionary,<br />
Longinus, pierced the young man with his lance<br />
At signs from me, moved by his agonies<br />
Through naysaying the drug they had offered him.<br />
It brought the end.&nbsp; And when he had breathed his last<br />
The woman went.&nbsp; I saw her never again . . .<br />
Now glares my moody meaning on you, friend?&mdash;<br />
That when you talk of offspring as sheer joy<br />
So trustingly, you blink contingencies.<br />
Fors Fortuna!&nbsp; He who goes fathering<br />
Gives frightful hostages to hazardry!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Panthera&rsquo;s
tale.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas one he seldom told,<br />
But yet it got abroad.&nbsp; He would unfold,<br />
At other times, a story of less gloom,<br />
Though his was not a heart where jests had room.<br />
He would regret discovery of the truth<br />
Was made too late to influence to ruth<br />
The Procurator who had condemned his son&mdash;<br />
<a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Or
rather him so deemed.&nbsp; For there was none<br />
To prove that Panthera erred not: and indeed,<br />
When vagueness of identity I would plead,<br />
Panther himself would sometimes own as much&mdash;<br />
Yet lothly.&nbsp; But, assuming fact was such,<br />
That the said woman did not recognize<br />
Her lover&rsquo;s face, is matter for surprise.<br />
However, there&rsquo;s his tale, fantasy or otherwise.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter shone not men of
Panthera&rsquo;s kind:<br />
The indolent heads at home were ill-inclined<br />
To press campaigning that would hoist the star <br />
Of their lieutenants valorous afar.<br />
Jealousies kept him irked abroad, controlled<br />
And stinted by an Empire no more bold.<br />
Yet in some actions southward he had share&mdash;<br />
In Mauretania and Numidia; there<br />
With eagle eye, and sword and steed and spur,<br />
Quelling uprisings promptly.&nbsp; Some small stir<br />
In Parthia next engaged him, until maimed,<br />
As I have said; and cynic Time proclaimed<br />
His noble spirit broken.&nbsp; What a waste<br />
<a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>Of such
a Roman!&mdash;one in youth-time graced<br />
With indescribable charm, so I have heard,<br />
Yea, magnetism impossible to word<br />
When faltering as I saw him.&nbsp; What a fame,<br />
O Son of Saturn, had adorned his name,<br />
Might the Three so have urged Thee!&mdash;Hour by hour<br />
His own disorders hampered Panthera&rsquo;s power<br />
To brood upon the fate of those he had known,<br />
Even of that one he always called his own&mdash;<br />
Either in morbid dream or memory . . .<br />
He died at no great age, untroublously,<br />
An exit rare for ardent soldiers such as he.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
